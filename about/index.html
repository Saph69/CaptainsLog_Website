            <p>
              Working professionaly in the Microsoft 365 and Azure space, i'm
              always trying to keep up with the latest technologies, and the
              latest trends. It all started when i saw an interview with the CEO
              of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, talking about the future of AI and
              how it will change the work space as we know it. He was
              specifically talking about AI Agents and how they eventually will
              replace all SAS applications.
              <br />
              (For those interested heres the interview:
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqAUv4UKXo"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Satya Nadella on AI Agents</a
              >) <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              I thought to myself "Wow that sounds like a bold statement" but i
              hadn't really looked much into AI agents myself.
              <br />
              <br />
              So i decided to look into it and see what all the fuss was about.
              I started to read about the latest tools and techniques, and how
              these "AI Agents" work. I purchased a subscription to openAI and
              started to play around with the API. I quickly discovered that
              with just a few lines of python code i could create an AI agent
              that could do simple tasks. I experimented with it for a few
              hours, giving it a few simple tasks to complete, but lacked
              inspiration to really leverage the full potential of the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was until i gave it the simple prompt -- "Your are a pirate,
              write a short story of your adventures"
            </p>
            <p>
              I was quite impressed with the results, from such a simple prompt!
              This is when i really started experimenting!
              <br />
              <br />
              Soon, before i knew it, i had created character profiles, back
              stories, locations, world building, pirate lore, and a whole lot
              more! I sat for hours, reading the stories my agent was
              telling me, and i was hooked!
              <br />
              <br />
              Thats when i had the thought, "I wonder if other people would
              enjoy these wacky stories as much as i have?" I had been looking
              for a creative project i could really sink my teeth into, and this
              seemed like a fun idea!
              <br />
              <br />
              and thus, the captains-journal was born.
            </p>

            <h2>Okay, heres what i'll do!</h2>
              I'll whip up a quick HTML page, host it in an Azure static website, write some simple code, host the text episodes in a Azure blobs storage and voila!
              <br>
              <br>
              Right ?
              <br>
              Right............... ?
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              mwahahha, Jake your poor little innocent flower, you have no idea what your about to get yourself into!
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
              Okay, i now have an AI agent that is convinced it's a captain of a pirate ship.
              <br> 
              It can now generate short stories in a text format, and output the .txt files locally on my machine.
              <br>
              This is cool, but i want to make a web series with daily episodes. Currently the agent can generates a short pirate story, save it as a .txt file, but next time the scrpt runs, it generates a new story and overwirtes the current .txt file.
              <br>    
              <br>
              Okay, lets make some changes to the code!
              <br>
              <br>
              Firstly, i need to update the agent itself.
              <br>
              Currently all the agent knows is, it is the captain of at pirate ship, and should tell short stories.
              I want to update the agent to be able to generate a new episode every day, the new episode should be a follow-up to the previous episode.
              If the last eipsode is captains_log_1.txt the next episode should be captains_log_2.txt and so on.
            <br>
              I started by updating the prompt for the agent.
            <br>
            <br>
              <img src="/images/prompt-update.png" alt="Prompt Update">
              <br>
              <br>


              I then made a few changes to the python script
              <br>
              The script now scans the local directy where the "captaions_log_X.txt files are created. If the script finds captains_log_1.txt it will then produce captains_log_2.txt, and so on.
              If no .txt files are found, the script will create a new episode.
              <br>
              <br>
              Okay, this is a good start, the agent is now able to generate a new episode every run, also name the file correctly, but the episodes are not consistant.
              <br>
               <br>
              If i want to make a web series with daily episodes. For this to work, its extremely important that episdoes are consistant. Each episode should be a continuation of the previous one.
              <br>
              It won't work if story arch keeps changing, characters are suddenly in different locations, doing different things etc...
              <br>
              <br>
              hmmmm what if i could generate a new episode every day, each episode following the same consistent story arch?
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3>Enter The Captains assistant!</h3>
              Okay, so i needed a way for the AI to keep track of the story, character arcs, locations visited, and especially what happened in the previous episode.
                <br>
                I managed to achieve this by adding an assistant to the prompt. The Assistant is responsible for reading all previous logs created in the story so far.
                <br>
                <br>
                So how does this work?
                <br>
                <br>
                Just like like the main agent, the assistant first checks the local file directory for any existing .txt files.
                Any existing .txt files found are passed to the assistant, the assistant then reads all exsisting .txt files and passes the content to the main agent.
                The main agent then receives a new prompt, with the assistant's memory as the context.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this case, if text files are found the agent will receive the prompt -  "Please write the next log entry, continuing the story from all previous logs while maintaining consistency in the story and character development" 
                <br>
                <br>
                If no text files were found, the agent will receivve the prompt - "You can write a complete log entry without worrying about length restrictions. Focus on maintaining story consistency and providing a complete narrative."
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm now able to generate consistant episodes, with a continous story arch.
                <br>
                Pretty cool right?
                <br>
                <br>
                but, now it's time to take it to the next level.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

              <h2>The Voice of the Captain</h2>
              This is where things start to get really interesting. (and also a little wacky ðŸ˜‚)
              <br>
              <br>
              I'm now able to generate a new episode every day, with a continous story arch, characters, locations, and a continous story.
              but it's just text.....
              <br>
              what if i could generate a audio version of each episode?
              <br>
              <br>
              Okay, time to hit the "Google-kung-fu" lets see what options i have!
              <br>
              <br>
              Oh snap! OpenAI has a text to speech API!
              <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI Text to Speech API</a>
              <br>
              <br>
              Okay lets see what we can build!
              <br><br>
              After reading through the documentation it was actually pretty quick and easy to get a prototype up and running.
              <br>
              I went with the voice "Ash" as i felt this was the voice that sounded best for a narrator. However, i wansn't 100% happy with the voice, so i deciced to experiment a bit, and this is where things get a bit wacky ðŸ˜‚
              <br><br>
              First i tried cloneing my own voice, and creating an AI version of myself to read the text.
              This actually worked better than i expected, which made it all the more creepy! One thing is listening to your own voice, but listening to yourself say things you've neveer said, or read words completely different was just to weird for me.
              <br><br>
              For those interested, here is a little preview of this freak!

              Next up i toke the pirate approach!
              <br>
              I read a bunch of text in a pirate voice, and tried to create an ai version of the voice,
              Needless to say, this evening i got alot of strange looks from my better half, as i sat yelling pirate slurs into my microphone.
              <br><br>
              This it what It ended up producingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

                  As i sit writing this blog, i'm still now entirely sure what voice i'm going to go with for the finished produt. I still have alot of experimentation to do with different API's and prodcuts, so i guess you'll have to wait and see!
