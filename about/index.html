            <p>
              Working professionaly in the Microsoft 365 and Azure space, i'm
              always trying to keep up with the latest technologies, and the
              latest trends. It all started when i saw an interview with the CEO
              of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, talking about the future of AI and
              how it will change the work space as we know it. He was
              specifically talking about AI Agents and how they eventually will
              replace all SAS applications.
              <br />
              (For those interested heres the interview:
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqAUv4UKXo"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Satya Nadella on AI Agents</a
              >) <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              I thought to myself "Wow that sounds like a bold statement" but i
              hadn't really looked much into AI agents myself.
              <br />
              <br />
              So i decided to look into it and see what all the fuss was about.
              I started to read about the latest tools and techniques, and how
              these "AI Agents" work. I purchased a subscription to openAI and
              started to play around with the API. I quickly discovered that
              with just a few lines of python code i could create an AI agent
              that could do simple tasks. I experimented with it for a few
              hours, giving it a few simple tasks to complete, but lacked
              inspiration to really leverage the full potential of the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was until i gave it the simple prompt -- "Your are a pirate,
              write a short story of your adventures"
            </p>
            <p>
              I was quite impressed with the results, from such a simple prompt!
              This is when i really started experimenting!
              <br />
              <br />
              Soon, before i knew it, i had created character profiles, back
              stories, locations, world building, pirate lore, and a whole lot
              more! I sat for hours, listening to the stories my agent was
              telling me, and i was hooked!
              <br />
              <br />
              Thats when i had the thought, "I wonder if other people would
              enjoy these wacky stories as much as i have?" I had been looking
              for a creative project i could really sink my teeth into, and this
              seemed like a fun idea!
              <br />
              <br />
              and thus, the captains-journal was born.
