            <p>
              Working professionaly in the Microsoft 365 and Azure space, i'm
              always trying to keep up with the latest technologies, and the
              latest trends. It all started when i saw an interview with the CEO
              of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, talking about the future of AI and
              how it will change the work space as we know it. He was
              specifically talking about AI Agents and how they eventually will
              replace all SAS applications.
              <br />
              (For those interested heres the interview:
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqAUv4UKXo"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Satya Nadella on AI Agents</a
              >) <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              I thought to myself "Wow that sounds like a bold statement" but i
              hadn't really looked much into AI agents myself.
              <br />
              <br />
              So i decided to look into it and see what all the fuss was about.
              I started to read about the latest tools and techniques, and how
              these "AI Agents" work. I purchased a subscription to openAI and
              started to play around with the API. I quickly discovered that
              with just a few lines of python code i could create an AI agent
              that could do simple tasks. I experimented with it for a few
              hours, giving it a few simple tasks to complete, but lacked
              inspiration to really leverage the full potential of the API.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was until i gave it the simple prompt -- "Your are a pirate,
              write a short story of your adventures"
            </p>
            <p>
              I was quite impressed with the results, from such a simple prompt!
              This is when i really started experimenting!
              <br />
              <br />
              Soon, before i knew it, i had created character profiles, back
              stories, locations, world building, pirate lore, and a whole lot
              more! I sat for hours, listening to the stories my agent was
              telling me, and i was hooked!
              <br />
              <br />
              Thats when i had the thought, "I wonder if other people would
              enjoy these wacky stories as much as i have?" I had been looking
              for a creative project i could really sink my teeth into, and this
              seemed like a fun idea!
              <br />
              <br />
              and thus, the captains-journal was born.
            </p>

            <h2>Okay, heres what i'll do!</h2>
              I'll whip up a quick HTML page, host it in an Azure static website, write some simple code, host the episodes in a Azure blobs storage and voila!
              <br>
              <br>
              Right ?
              <br>
              Right............... ?
              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Little did i know, what i was about to get myself into!
              <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
              Okay, i now have an AI agent that is convinced it's a captain of a pirate ship.
              <br> 
              It can now generate short stories in a text format, and output the .txt files locally on my machine.
              <br>
              This is cool, but i want to make a web series with daily episodes. Currently the agent can generates a short pirate story, save it as a .txt file, but next time the scrpt runs, it generates a new story and overwirtes the current .txt file.
              <br>    
              <br>
              Okay, lets make some changes to the code!
              <br>
              <br>
              Firstly, i need to update the agent itself.
              <br>
              Currently all the agent knows is, it is the captain of at pirate ship, and should tell short stories.
              I want to update the agent to be able to generate a new episode every day, the new episode should be a follow-up to the previous episode.
              If the last eipsode is captains_log_1.txt the next episode should be captains_log_2.txt and so on.
            <br>
              I started by updating the prompt for the agent.
            <br>
            <br>
              <img src="/images/prompt-update.png" alt="Prompt Update">
              <br>
              <br>


              I then made a few changes to the python script
              <br>
              The script now scans the local directy where the "captaions_log_X.txt files are created. If the script finds captains_log_1.txt it will then produce captains_log_2.txt, and so on.
              If no .txt files are found, the script will create a new episode.
              <br>
              <br>
              Okay, this is a good start, the agent is now able to generate a new episode every run, also name the file correctly, but the episodes are not consistant.
              <br>
               <br>
              If i want to make a web series with daily episodes. For this to work, its extremely important that episdoes are consistant. Each episode should be a continuation of the previous one.
              <br>
              It won't work if story arch keeps changing, characters are suddenly in different locations, doing different things etc...
              <br>
              <br>
              hmmmm what if i could generate a new episode every day, each episode following the same consistent story arch?
              <br>
