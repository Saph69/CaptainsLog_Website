          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Farack is a smooth-talking hustler with a knack for survival and a
            terrible sense of balance. He's always falling overboard, despite
            the fact that he cannot swim. He's charming, cocky, and always
            working an angle, whether it's a high-stakes gamble or talking his
            way out of a noose. He prefers to fight from a distance, using his
            razor-sharp throwing cards to take down enemies before they get too
            close.

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Big Bertha is an unstoppable force of nature, feared by enemies and
            fiercely protective of her crew. She's as tough as old leather, loud
            as a cannon blast, and strong enough to shatter bones with a single
            punch. But beneath the brawler's exterior, she has a soft
            spot‚Äîespecially for her ragtag pirate family. And Farack. Though
            she'd rather be marooned than admit it.

              üí• <strong>Unstoppable Force</strong> - If there's a brawl, Bertha
              starts it and finishes it. She once punched a shark for getting

            <li>
              üõ°Ô∏è <strong>Fiercely Protective</strong> - The crew is her family.

              üçó <strong>Loves to Eat</strong> - Her appetite is legendary.
              Whole barrels of rum and turkey legs the size of a man's head are

              üé∂ <strong>Secret Talent: Singing</strong> - Has a shockingly

            soul, he treats his craft with almost religious intensity. He looks
            like a monk, speaks like a philosopher, and fights like a demon with
            a meat cleaver. Insult his cooking? You might wake up with "Mercy"
            embedded in your hammock.
