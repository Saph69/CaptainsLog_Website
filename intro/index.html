          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Farack is a smooth-talking hustler with a knack for survival and a
            terrible sense of balance. He's always falling overboard, despite
            the fact that he cannot swim. He's charming, cocky, and always
            working an angle, whether it's a high-stakes gamble or talking his
            way out of a noose. He prefers to fight from a distance, using his
            razor-sharp throwing cards to take down enemies before they get too
            close.

            Fuyu is a walking bad omen, and the crew hates it. She's mildly

            her pet snake in people's hammocks for fun. Whether she's actually a

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Big Bertha is an unstoppable force of nature, feared by enemies and
            fiercely protective of her crew. She's as tough as old leather, loud
            as a cannon blast, and strong enough to shatter bones with a single
            punch. But beneath the brawler's exterior, she has a soft
            spot—especially for her ragtag pirate family. And Farack. Though
            she'd rather be marooned than admit it.

          <ul class="trait-list">
            <li>
              💥 <strong>Unstoppable Force</strong> - If there's a brawl, Bertha
              starts it and finishes it. She once punched a shark for getting
              too close to the ship.
            </li>
            <li>
              🛡️ <strong>Fiercely Protective</strong> - The crew is her family.
              If anyone threatens them, they'll need a very good doctor.
            </li>
            <li>
              🍗 <strong>Loves to Eat</strong> - Her appetite is legendary.
              Whole barrels of rum and turkey legs the size of a man's head are
              just snacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              ❤️ <strong>Secretly in Love with Farack</strong> - Leads to
              hilarious misunderstandings. When flustered, she punches walls.
              And tables. And sometimes people.
            </li>
            <li>
              📢 <strong>Booming Voice</strong> - Loud enough to be heard over
              cannon fire. Can silence an entire tavern with a single shout.
            </li>
            <li>
              🎶 <strong>Secret Talent: Singing</strong> - Has a shockingly
              beautiful singing voice, but she'd rather punch you than let you
              know.

            <li>

            SoulSlayer is a man possessed. Whether he's slow-roasting a perfect
            pork shoulder or forging a blade that could cut through a man's
            soul, he treats his craft with almost religious intensity. He looks
            like a monk, speaks like a philosopher, and fights like a demon with
            a meat cleaver. Insult his cooking? You might wake up with "Mercy"
            embedded in your hammock.
